# GOAL    
    Analyze the dataset to measure the salaries of data scientists and what type of data scientists get much or less salaries. 
    After that find out how much our company must pay for data scientists by using ML

# Tools and libraries that i used in this project:


    ⚫Tools: Jupyter Notebook and SQL

    ⚫Visualizing = Matplotlib 

    ⚫Feature Engineering = Pandas&Numpy 

    ⚫Machine Learning = Sci-kit Learn as a library, Linear Regression&Lasso&Ridge, GradientBoostingRegressor


# Summary:

Analyze the dataset by using Matplotlib&Pandas: 

    Conclusion

1-) The Companies&Salaries are regularly scattered but small companies pays much more than Medium companies

2-) Data Scientist salaries are high with %57.6, middle with % 41.3 and minimum with %1.1
